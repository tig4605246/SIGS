### Updates
  2017/04/20 : log function (Open database, Create data table, Write back to databese, Retreive from database)


## Purpose

  Wrap on some Open source libraries to make a simple IoT Gateway Software.
  The goal is to ease the pain during the development in the future.

## Milestones

### First Stage

* Core functions : Things that make the system can start & stop and run properly

  * definitions : structs and MACROS
  * ipcs : how processes communicate with each other
  * controlling : start & stop Uploaders or Collectors

### Second Stage 

* Event-Handler : Dealing with real-time events. 

  * Event : Including definitions of events , errors and the handling functions

* logs & info : The backup of our data

  * data log : Save data files for a certain period of time. (Default is 7 days)
  * Info log : Save the events and errors happened during runtime

### Third Stage 

* Protocols : Providing functions that supports interacting with protocols 

  * Modbus :
  * Https  :
  * MQTT   :

* Remote Management : backdoors and APIs for remote management.

  * Reverse SSH Tunnel :

### Final Stage

* Wrapping up : SDK, documents and example programs

## Current Structure

                 |-- Uploaders  : Upload data to target places
                 |
    SGSmaster--- |--   Logger   : Create formatted logs with sqlite3 db
                 |
                 |-- Collectors : Collect and parse data

  We can change uploaders and Collectors without revising anything in the middle.
  It can ease the pain while developing new programs for new servers and sensors.

## Include

* External Libraries
  * [libmodbus 3.0.6](https://github.com/stephane/libmodbus)
  * [libcurl](https://curl.haxx.se/)
  * [cJSON](https://github.com/DaveGamble/cJSON)
  * [sqlite3](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html)
* Packages Needed
  * [sendmail](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/products/sendmail-sentrion) __Not in use right now__
  * [OpenSSH](https://www.openssh.com/)

## Compile
