To-Do-List:

A. Smart Campus
    
    1. Dynamic cpm70_agent: 
        
        Put mongo and agent together, refresh list everytime before we try to retrieve the data

B. Solar Project

    Rebuild structure: fit the need of Solar Project

    1. Rebuild core structure  (1 week = 7 days work time)

        |   Master & Submaster communication
        |   Shared memory list (Static or Dynamic ?)
        |   Event handler (Log and mailing system)
        |   local db (sqlite3)
        |   mailing system

    2. Build Solar Agent (1 week = 7 days work time)

        |   collector
        |   uploader

        



    3. All codes (Currently planned)
        |   SGSmaster [done]
        |   UploaderMaster [done]
        |   DataBufferMaster [done]
        |   CollectorMaster [done]
        |   EventHandler [done]
        |   MailingAgent [done]
        |   Logger [done]
        |   SolarPost [done]
        |   SolarPut   [undone]
        |   SolarCollect [undone]


Notes:

    test/sendmail.c will work, but some libraries are needed (libcurl and libssh2).

    Since printf is not reentrant function, using printf in sigaction callback funtion is not safe.

    The db must be clean before any change to Collector's AutoList. 

    make a function about reading configs (with inter process lock) seems reasonable.

    Finish logger's process message then we'll move to real uploader and collector.

    tx rx inf ifconfig could be big number, watch out. 

    GWInfo's path is currently hard coded.

    sqlitebrowser needs libqt4-dev package

    timer will +4 on its own. If there are some timing issues, check them first.

    Final list:

        1.collector/upload master need to process CONTROL and RESULT command

        2.

            finish SolarPut (data format correction, upload part)

            record Inverter, Irr and temp status, 
            (May revise the conf file or just use the status in the dLog, for example, add Inv_Status_01 to tags represents inverter status)

            invoke delete function in logger

        3.Test run with commands and Eric

        4.Write Readme
